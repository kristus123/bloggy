Writing tests is an investment that saves time in the future.

The type of tests which is the cheapest and most effective are those that test as much as possible with as little effort as possible.

e2e tests are a good way of testing the entire value-chain.

TDD will without a doubt guide your design.
How would code look like if it had full test coverage, but without any unit tests? It would probably look like code at its purest form.

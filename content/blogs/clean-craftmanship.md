The more specific a test becomes, the more general the production code becomes.

If you are stuck with getting a test to pass, make a test that is even simpler to pass.

one-to-one ratio of tests and classes are not needed and will lead to high coupling between production code and tests.

You can test 5 classes by simply writing tests for one. Mocking is not necessary all the time.
Think of the norwegian guy who talked about writing as little tests as possible but still able to achieve high level of validation.

The book itself is a path that might seem familiar to many, as he revisits a lot of topics that he has been talking about many times before.
I still enjoyed the book, and i will probably read it again in a year. Hopefully i can get some more out of it in my next reading.

It also gave good insight to the story of programming, but do not expect a revolutionary book.

It goes deep into testing, and how to do **TDD**, and he also talks about its siblings **BDD** and **AAA**.

He also talks about the story of how **YAGNI** was first looked upon as crazy talk. Back in the days it was expensive to do changes for many reasons, so adding all thinkable features (big design up front) was looked deemed a good practise. In our times, we have a much shorter feedback cycle which gives us the advantage of being able to create what we need when we need it.

In order to value your time you cannot allow people to waste your time.

Spend your time the way you want to spend it. It is your life, and you decide how you want to live.

# " It is hard for me to say no because I Don't want to be mean "

That is a waste of energy to think. You avoid being mean by not being a bad person

There is a time and place for everything. If you donn't want to talk with someone, then it is not the time and place to do so.

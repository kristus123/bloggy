When you are having a discussion or you are guiding people on their design solution it might at times be hard to express why something is done.
Maybe you are following the patterns unique to the project, or you have some strong principles that are there to guide a simple design.

Either way you have to make sure the counterpart understands what you are trying to tell them, and not just give them instructions.


### If there are hundreds of things to focus on, you should deal with one thing at a time.
It is not a race to have the person take in loads of information at record time.
The ideal tempo is when everyone can work at a comfortable pace.

### Look at it from the other person's perspective

It's hard to get tons of tasks thrown at you and **I am not surpsised** if they forget at least a few things.

#### - Make it easy for the other person to track the progress by setting clear goals
#### - The task can also function as a lesson, then you can reflect on how it was solved

### The faintest ink is better than the strongest memory
If you hand out tasks, make sure the person writes them down or give them a list of what to do so they can feel more in control.

When you don't have control over what you are supposed to do, anxiety is not far away.

### Keep it short, and listen to any questions.

When too much info is given at the same time, they will simply nod and agree in order to avoid getting loaded with more info. Their brain goes into a defensive state and tries to shield *themselves** from an overload of information.

**this has been proven in scientific studies, but i will need to find the source. I read it in a book*

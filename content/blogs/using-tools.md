Do not waste your time on tasks that should require no effort. Eliminate such activities as they give little value.

<content-space-bottom></content-space-bottom>

let's do some simple math:

All the cool kids commits to `git`

```bash
git add --all
 git commit -m "message"
 git push
```

Why don't just do
```bash
gc "message"
```

There are tons of things you do, which could be simplified. Everything ranging from terminal commands to repeated activites like opening certain websites or doing certain activites which could be scripted.

let's say you spend 15 seconds a day writing commands in order to commit to a branch (and 15 seconds is probably the most generous number i have ever given)


```
15_seconds_spent_on_daily_git_tasks * 365_days_of_hacking
=
5475_seconds_spent_gitting |
91.25_minutes_spent_gitting
```

Without much effort you can reduce that time by 10 seconds

<space-bottom></space-bottom>

```
5_seconds_spent_on_daily_git_tasks * 365_days_of_hacking
=
1825_seconds_spent_gitting_with_helper_commands |
30.42_minutes_spent_gitting_with_helper_commands
```

```
91.25_minutes_spent_gitting - 30.42_minutes_spent_gitting_with_helper_commands
=
minutes_saved_every_year | 60.83
```

which is `60.83` minutes saved every year. This might not seem like much, but that is because we have only focused on one **VERY** simple activity.

what if we do the same calculation with 15 other acitivtes that makes you save 10 seconds every day

```
30.42_minutes_spent_gitting_with_helper_commands * 10_similar_tasks
=
456.3_minutes_saved_every_year |
7.6_hours_saved_every_year
```
### Final words
Not only will you save time, but your fingers and wrists will thank you for letting them get a break every once in a while.
Doing repeatable tasks which involves lots of mouse clicking and wrist movement is considered a crime in Norway

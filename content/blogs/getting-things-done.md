GTD

A skill and mindset that gives a calm mind and control over every situation.

Being a person who won't forget something is a reliable person.

A person who knows everything he needs to do can prioritize and spend his time efficiently.

There are a lot of links between Lean and GTD.

It is about always improving the process.

The mind is not made for remembering. Write it down.

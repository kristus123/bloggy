It is all about the context and what makes sence.

does it make sense to pass the object ?
or does theo bject by random luck have all required fields?

example
getCompany(userObject)
getCompany(userId, organisationNumber)

information hiding is the most powerful we have, but it is a plus to make connections as obvious as possible.

Limiting connections will simplify your system, that's why passing single value arguments is a good thing (when it is appropriate of ocuse)

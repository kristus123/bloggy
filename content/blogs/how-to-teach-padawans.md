have a plan

remember they might be afraid to ask


they get bored too
give them challenges.
let them try new things.
be there and help them.

if you let someone think that you think they are stupid, they will start believing it.
"we are gonna believe you, not ourselves"

you gotta believe in them.
if you belive, they will believe.

"we can only be as good as you are."

we will copy you. if you are a book worm, we will be too.

Formal coding conventions.
The convention should uphold the conceptual integrity.

What should they include ?

Concrete or abstract ?

Conventions exists in the code, not in a documentation.


Either written down or part of the culture.

It written down, it should be made simple to follow and maintaned.

The document could also live close with the code.

Upholding conventions requires time and patience.

If stress and speed is the culture, you can simply ignore strong integrity as it will fall apart.

Dicipline is needed in order to pull it off.

This is not a one-time job, but will carry on for the duration of the project.

The culture is more important than a formal convention. the culture is stronger than written principles.

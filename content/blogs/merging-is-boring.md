Merging is boring or hard and I am Stupid or lazy.

Therefore i work in a way which avoids having to deal with merge conflicts.

This is also something which implicitly leads me to also work in a very iterative way, doing one thing at a time.
Some times you might feel that you should keep pushing forward, but that won't necessarily make you finish things faster.

No matter how fast you work, it will all be completed in the same time.
You should do it the right way, not the fast way.

Using speed to determ whether you are delivering results is not a healthy mindset.

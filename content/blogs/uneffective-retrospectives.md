@kiran#5013 Regarding the frist part of the retrospective (what we did well)

The retrospective meeting did not focus on what we did well as a team. It focused on what every individual did and their experiences.

There is no need for everyone to say that `it was fun to learn a new framework etc etc etc`

it is enough for one person to write it down on the whiteboard
```
# What did we do well
- Fun to learn a new framework
```

Not everybody needs to repeat it if everyone had a similar experience. Remove duplicate entries.

This was more of a "what did everyone do this week and how fun it was and how amazing we all are" meeting and not a retrospective meeting.

Way too long time was spent on going through 'what went well'.

Next time things should be summarised more efficiently for everyone's sake.

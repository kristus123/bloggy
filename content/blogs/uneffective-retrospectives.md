@kiran#5013 Regarding the frist part of the retrospective (what we did well)

The retrospective meeting did not focus on what we did well as a team. It focused on what every individual did and their experiences.

There is no need for everyone to say that `it was fun to learn a new framework etc etc etc`

it is enough for one person to write it down on the whiteboard
```
# What did we do well
- Fun to learn a new framework
```

Not everybody needs to repeat it.

This was more of a "what did everyone do this week and how fun it was and how amazing we all are" meeting

Way too long time was spent on going through what went well.

Effectively this was our list of what we did well. And we spent equal amount of time on each of the lines (even though they were identical)

```
(this is just an example)

# What did we do well
- Fun to learn a new framework
- Fun to learn a new framework
- Fun to learn a new framework
- Fun to learn a new framework
```

It was in kind words a waste of time

Next time things should be summarised more efficiently for everyone's sake.

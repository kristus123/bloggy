In chaos there is order, and in order exists chaos.

There will always be chaos. It is needed. Peace and order can not exist without chaos and destruction.
In every decision you make, chaos is present. It's a simple rule that guides the universe.

Thus there is no solution that will give you **just** order and control.

By practicing this you will be able to accept that you will never be in full control, which will give you a peaceful mind.
As long as order exists, the opposite force will be present.

When you have accepted that. you will be able to find the ultimate solution and live in harmony with chaos.

You should learn about the chaos you have created.
You should treat chaos as a friend.

There is no good or bad, only the whole.

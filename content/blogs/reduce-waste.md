Find out what does not give value.

Simply remove it

Does 1000 tasks in the backlog add value ? If not then remove them. (Mary)

If your team can only complete 10 tasks every week, what is the point of 200 tasks ? Requirements and focus will change, which will probably make it so you never complete those tasks.
A tight feedback loop also means having little in the backlog.

- Waste is your enemy
- Waste slows you down
- Waste is expensive
- time wasted is a waste of time

Keep an eye open, as waste grows slowly without you noticing.

Be Lean

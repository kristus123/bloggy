Clear purpose, and why should it be done.

how should it be done ?

How to test and verify?

Clearly be able to know when the task is done.

Easy to understand.

If hard to estimate, split it into smaller tasks.

Meethings should only be held for super large tasks, or else a meeting is a waste of time.

Meetings should be an addition to a well defined task, not its only source of what, how and why things are being done.

Making solutions that are easy to test and verify is a goal that should be strived for.

It gives confidence to know that you are not breaking anything.

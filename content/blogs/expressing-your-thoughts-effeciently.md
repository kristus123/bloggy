When you are having a discussion or you are guiding juniors on their design solution, it might some times be hard to express why something is done. Maybe you are following the patterns unique to the project, or you have some strong principles that are there to guide a simple design.

Either way you have to make sure the counterpart understands what you are trying to tell them, and not just give them instructions and have them hack and slash on the keyboard because that is what they have been told to do.

Keep it short, and listen to any questions.
When there are 100 things to take in, you should focus on 1 thing a time. It is not a race to have the person take in loads of information at record time. If it is for example a new feature that is working, but the code quality does not follow best practises, it should be iterately dealt with and fix one thing at a time.

When too much info is given at one time, they will simply nod and agree to avoid getting loaded with even more info when they ask their questions.


When you are in the position where people overwhelm you with information, you should let them know, and suggest to take one thing at a time only.
The goal of communication is not to waste somebodyÂ´s time, but rather deliver your message as effeciently as possible.

Sitting idle doing nothing will not solve any problem.

Your time is valuable, and you decide when your time is being wasted or not.

When you feel the person drifts away from the original topic, you should let them know and help them get quickly back to focus.

When you are having a discussion or you are guiding people on their design solution it might at times be hard to express why something is done.
Maybe you are following the patterns unique to the project, or you have some strong principles that are there to guide a simple design.

Either way you have to make sure the counterpart understands what you are trying to tell them, and not just give them instructions.


### If there are hundreds of things to focus on, you should iterately deal with one thing at a time.
It is not a race to have the person take in loads of information at record time.

It's hard to get tons of tasks thrown at you, and even harder if those tasks are only verbally given.
Most people don't write down what they are supposed to do, which means they end up forgetting at least one thing.

When you don't have control over what you are supposed to do, that is when your brain starts feeling anxiety.

### The faintest ink is better than the strongest memory

If you hand out tasks, make sure the person writes them down somehow, or you give them a list of what to do so they can feel more in control.

### Keep it short, and listen to any questions.

When too much info is given at the same time, they will simply nod and agree to avoid getting loaded with even more info. Their brain goes into a defensive state and tries to shield themselves.

*(this has been proven in scientific studies)*

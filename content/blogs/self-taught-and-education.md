Education is good. Self-taught knowledge is good.
In the end you have both reached the same destination.

## Both are educated. Both are self-taught.

There is no need to spend energy thinking which path is better. They are the same.
Both lead to the same destination, and when both have reached the same destination
it is as if there never was two separate paths.

## The person decides where his path takes him, not the road

It is for you to decide which path you want to go.

Don't waste energy looking back thinking you have wasted time.
That is a foolish way to look at life.

Spend no time believing you have wasted some years in a classroom.
Spend no time thinking you have wasted your life learning something on your own.

### One path might bring friendship, while the other might be lonely.
It is up to you to figure out how to get what you want out of the road you are currently on.

Education is good. Self-taught knowledge is good.
In the end you have both reached the same destination.

## Both are educated. Both are self-taught.

There is no need to spend energy thinking which path is better. They are the same.
Both lead to the same destination, and when both have reached the same destination
it is as if there never was two separate paths.

## The person decides where his path takes him, not the road

It is for you to decide which path you want to go.

Don't waste energy looking back thinking you have wasted time.
That is a foolish way to look at life.

Spend no time believing you have wasted some years in a classroom.
Spend no time thinking you have wasted your life learning something on your own.

### One path might bring friendship, while the other might be lonely.
It is up to you to figure out how to get what you want out of the road you are currently on.

unfinished draft:

Tom and Mary Poppendieck talked about bootcamps.

"""
They teach you to write javascript, but not how to think.

The need for developers rise every day.

The need for sophisticated software engineers does not.
"""

Someone who read this blog post used bootcamps as an example of someone who cheated and said they prefer 'the self-taught'

It feels like this person missed the whole point.

Did the self-taught cheat by reading a book ?
Did the educated cheat by reading a book ?
Does the self-taught cheat by going to a bootcamp ?
Does the educated cheat by going to a bootcamp ?

The point was that whether you get formal guidance or you guided  yourself, they are still getting to the same destination, they just take different paths.

"The self-taught has more drive and interest"
Not necessarily. The reason i wrote this is because i am impressed by how much time and dedication it takes to formally study at a university. The very fact that people go through this is a testament to their perseverance.

Yes, you will see a difference of skill between the educated and the self-taught, but that doesn't mean one is better than the other. It means they are at different stage in their development of understanding what it means to be a software engineer. They have different perspectives which will guide them further towards what they think their goals are.

The work at DNB, and what I did

## The beginning

While at DNB I started spending even more of my free time reading articles/books and watching videos/conferences.

The people I worked with were really knowledgeable in the field of software so there was a lot to learn from them
and I took full advantage of them by bombarding them with questions and discussions.

During these years I always kept digging for golden nuggets of knowledge.
I am very fascinated by software, and I read *(and reread)* many books on this topic.

Many of my thoughts and opinions on software were quite wrong.

*(some thoughts survived, but as Aristotle says: "It is hard to avoid the truth")*

## A wakeup call

After getting tendonitis 2 years into the job I started thinking quite a lot about the dangers that can occur when neglecting your body.
This was when I also started realizing how much wasteful activities that we do every day when we are on the computer.

When every keystroke is painful, you will start thinking differently on how you work on a computer.

I decided to start going to the gym and spending less time on the computer.

## 3 years later

I felt there was no more knowledge or experience to gain,
the job was repetetive,
and I did not have as fun at work as I used to.
On top of that I started having trouble with sleep.

After a while It was obvious that it was time for change.

This quote from my coworker was quite impactful, and made the decision even easier to make.

I decided to quit my job in order to focus on other things.
My goals were to get into the habit of exercising, learn new skills, and enjoy life.

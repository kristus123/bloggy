In chaos there is order, and in order exists chaos.

There will always be chaos. It is needed.
Peace and order can not exist without chaos and destruction.

In every decision you make, chaos is present.
It is a simple rule that guides the universe.

## Thus there is no solution that will only bring order and control.

You will never be in full control. As long as order exists, the opposite force will be present.

Find the perfect solution and live in harmony with chaos.

## There is no good or bad, only the whole.

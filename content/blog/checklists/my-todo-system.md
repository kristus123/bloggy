The goal is to make your brain not have to keep track of every single thing you need to do.

This can be achieved by knowing that whatever you need to do,
it is written down somewhere and you will be reminded to do it either when you check your list
or with an automatic reminder.

After spending many hours thinking, practicing and improving my way of handling
all the things that needs to be done in life, I have trained/rewired
my brain on how to deal with all the things that needs to be done.

In order to stay on top of things, you need to have an overview of everything that is happening in your life. There are hundreds of things you need to do every week.

Your brain should live a relaxing life, and being in the age of computers,
it is a waste not to take advantage of the tools we have today.

In order to stay on top of things, there are a few things you can do:

- Write down every task you have *(And have a clear action for what you need to do next with it)*

- Put everything from your brain into your system *(Note down your ideas or tasks at the moment they appear)*

- Write down dreams and future plans that you someday would like to do *(because future plans also occupy your mind)*

- Categorize and organize the tasks

- Reflect and be ruthless *(remove a task that no longer fits your goals or priorities)*

## An example

When I have some tasks i need to do on my computer, i put a note within the laptop so that when i open my laptop it will instantly remind me of what i need to do.

<my-hr class="pb-6"></my-hr>

All of this require practice, but once you have done it for a long time,
there is no going back.

There is a big quality of life improvement by keeping track of everything you need to do.

## Custom tools

I have made my own todo app and reminder app which makes it even easier for me to keep track of everything.

# Books to recommend

During my time at DNB, I read the book **"The art of stress-free productivity"**.

My first thought was "this is an old book", but the content is timeless and definitely worth reading.

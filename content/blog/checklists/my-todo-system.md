I consider myself someone who is really good at keeping track of things.
Having spent many hours thinking, practicing and improving my way of handling all the things that needs to be done in life, I have trained/rewired my brain on how to deal with all the things that needs to be done.

In order to stay on top of things, you need to have an overview over everything that is happening in your life. There are hundreds of things you need to do every week.

Your brain should live a relaxing life, and being in the age of computers,
it is a waste not to take advantage of the tools we have today. (link to how i do things)

In order to stay on top of things, there are a few things you need to do:

- Write down every task you have *(And have a clear action for what you need to do next with it)*

- Put everything from your brain into your system *(Note down your ideas or tasks at the moment they appear)*

- Write down dreams and future plans that you someday would like to do *(because future plans also occupy your mind)*

- Categorize and organize the tasks

- Reflect and be ruthless *(remove a task that no longer fits your goals or priorities)*

The goal is to make your brain not having to keep track of everything.
This can be achieved by knowing that whatever you need to do, it is written down somewhere and you will be reminded to do it either when you check your list or you set up an automatic reminder.

## An example

When I have some tasks i need to do on my computer, i put a note within the laptop so that when i open my laptop it will instantly remind me of what i need to do.

All of this require practice, but once you have done it for a long time,
there is no going back.
Your brain gets to be in a peaceful state
because it doesn't have to worry about keeping track of absolutely everything in your life.

There is a big quality of life improvement by keeping track of everything you need to do.

## Become stress-free

The reason you stress is because there is so much to do.
There is only 24 hours in a day, so there is a limit on how much you can do every day.

Change your idea about what it means to be productive!

## The vault

For many years I've been thinking *"A todo-app isn't enough for me"*, so I decided to make **The vault**, which is just another todo app.

**The vault** is where i put todo tasks that will live on for a long time and has many features to help me remember all the things I need to do.

## Daily habit helper

There are many things you need to do every day.
I found that storing these in the todo app clutters it up quite a lot,
so i made a tool that sends me notifications whenever i want it to.

It can send daily, weekly, etc etc, whatever I need.

# Books to recommend

During my time at DNB, I read the book **"The art of stress-free productivity"**.

![Cover of GTD book](https://gyazo.com/3ac5e77bac5f82a550d3e8e4fcd451d1.png)

My first thought was "this is an old book", but the content is timeless and definitely worth reading.

title: Built-in dicipline

The goal is to relive the need for dicipline and willpower.
The solution does not need to be perfect, as long as it works 95% of the time, it is more than enough to provide substantial results.

Through a few iterations, this is what happened:

# 1.0

- Block phone and computer
- Block the entire internet

## Post mortem

This worked, but eventually I found a way to bypass the block on both phone and pc.
This led to the block only working sub-optimally.

# 2.0

- 2 hour limit on computer *with a block that is impossible to bypass*
- Start using a traditional phone *and give phone to my friend so i don't have my smartphone*


# 3.0

You have to give the phone to someone you trust and who can also see the value in limiting yourself from using a smartphone.
This is cruicial, because if they are not strict, you will get the phone and they will not care.

You need to give it to someone who is **on the grind**.

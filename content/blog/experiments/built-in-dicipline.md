The goal is to relive the need for dicipline and willpower.

Through many iterations, this is what happened:

## 1.0

- Block phone and computer
	- Password block
	- Block the entire internet

*This worked, but eventually I found a way to bypass the block.*
*This led to the block only working in a sub-optimal way*

## 2.0

- 2 hour limit on computer
- Start using a traditional phone
	- Give phone to my friend so i don't have my smart-phone

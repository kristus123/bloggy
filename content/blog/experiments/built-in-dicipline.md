title: Built-in dicipline

The goal is to relive the need for dicipline and willpower.

Through a few iterations, this is what happened:

# 1.0

- Block phone and computer
	- Password block
	- Block the entire internet

## Post mortem

This worked, but eventually I found a way to bypass the block.
This led to the block only working in a sub-optimal way.

# 2.0

- 2 hour limit on computer *with a block that is impossible to bypass*
- Start using a traditional phone
	- Give phone to my friend so i don't have my smartphone

You have to give the phone to someone you trust and who can also see the value in limiting yourself from using a smartphone.

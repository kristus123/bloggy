Before I get back into a new job my plan is to:

- Improve my knowledge in Software engineering ✅
- Improve my knowledge in machine-learning ✅
- Be able to speak basic chinese ✅
- Get some muscle on my body ✅
- Keep improving my existing skills ✅
- Made a game-engine ✅
- Made a game ✅

## Next plan

My next goal is to find a part-time job.

I miss programming on bigger projects.

Even though i still program on my own stuff every day, it is not the same as working in a more professional setting.

## Graduate program for people with a completed education

After 3 months of training in Oslo, I started working in DNB.

Originally i applied directly to 'Experis Academy',
but was declined as I did not have higher education.
Their reasons for not wanting to hire me were understandable.

Luckily the people at DNB were eager to have me on board.

From my perspective it was not straight forward to hire me because of some policies regarding education, 
thus Experis sent me on a `graduate program` tailored for postgraduate students.

That is how i ended up living in Oslo for 3 months.

The time spent in oslo was the most fun months so far in my life at that time.

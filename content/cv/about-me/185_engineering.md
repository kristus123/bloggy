I consider myself a highly experienced and knowledgeable person.

### This confidence comes from

- Testing out different patterns and principles in theory and in production and understanding their pros and cons
- Working in large systems 
- Researching vigorously into what it means to write *"good"* code
- a good eye for planning and prioritizing


The biggest excitement I have had in this field is when I learn something that changes my beliefs and ideas about software.

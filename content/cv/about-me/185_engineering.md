I consider myself a highly experienced and knowledgeable person.

### This confidence comes from

- Testing out different patterns and principles in theory and in production and understanding their pros and cons
- Working in large systems 
- Digging for golden nuggets of wisdom for a long time
- Going deep into what it means to write *"good"* code

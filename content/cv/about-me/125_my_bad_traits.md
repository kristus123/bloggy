These are **NOT** my way of *turning my weaknesses into my strengths*.
These are the most unhealthy habit I have, and every day I have to be very mindful of it.

## An insane focus

Being focused for hours is a bad thing.
I am using a tool called [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com) to make it eaiser for me to keep track of time and take breaks

## I have high expectations of myself


I am really jealous of my friend who is contempt in life.
For me, every day is a day to improve.

I am working on being more relaxed in this area of life.

One way I want to achieve this inner peace is by becoming a true philosopher.

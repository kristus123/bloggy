I have worked with many languages in multiple environments, and I enjoy learning and improve my skillset.
I'm sitting on top of a lot of knowledge, and I'm still looking for ways to learn more.

One of my stronger skills is being able to plan out every step that is needed in order to solve a problem,
and see the entire picture when working in a system.

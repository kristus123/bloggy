- Worked with many languages in multiple environments
- I Enjoy learning and improve my skillset
- Good at working in a very structured manner


I'm sitting on top of a lot of knowledge, and I'm still looking for ways to learn more.

One of my stronger skills is being able to plan out every step that is needed to solve a problem,
and see the entire picture when working in a system.

## Quitting my job to improve

Many people warned me about having *"a hole in my CV"*, but I didn't worry about that.

Would they have said the same thing if i went back to school to study?

If improving yourself and your skills is what matters, then staying at my job or jumping straight into a new job would not be the right choice.

### Why quit ?

My motivation for quitting my job was to:

- reset my brain and hopefully get a new perspectives
- Learn more about the art of software engineering

I have definitely succeeded at my goal,
and I'm glad i let my brain take a break from monotone work.
Hopefully I even forgot some wisdom which later can be reclaimed from a new perspective.

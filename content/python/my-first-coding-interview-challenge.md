The task was fun, but the main challenge was more about the beaty of design, architecture and decision-making.

**4'ish** hours were estimated to be used on it. I solved the task quickly in order to have a working system as a reference, and later spent time thinking about the code and refactoring.

## My approach

Changes and decision are done in a very short feedback-cycle. Everytime you better your understanding of the domain you will see a way to more clearly reflect the domain and what it's trying to solve in the code.

I did not do test-first-development, but i did write code and shortly after verified that it worked by testing it.
The quickest *(ironically)* and most pragmatic solution was to do it this way.

However, I would not do it like this all the time. if this was a larger project it would be better to take your time in order to build quality into the solution from the very start.

It is true without a doubt that the tools that are used guide the solution and design of a project.

[Scott Wlaschin](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0TKksLKlMLyoyYPTiK07OLylRKM9JLE7OyMwDAKcdCvQ&q=scott+wlaschin&oq=scott+w&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46i39j46i512l4j69i60l2.1456j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) talks about how he likes to model the domain and do [event storming](https://www.google.com/search?q=event+storming&oq=event+sot&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i10l9.1862j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
He starts by **not** thinking about the domain in terms of SQL-tables and classes.


Limiting the perspective to software terminology will hurt the overall understanding of the domain and will lead to a sub-optimal solution and design.








## How my tools shaped the solution

Decisions and work-ethics were guided by the fact that i worked on my Windows pc, which meant I didn't have my custom tools.

Over the years you become lazy and still want to work efficiently. Tools and custom setup will help you achieve a higher level of efficiency without sacrificing precious calories.

Certain things I did not bother to do, as it would require effort to achieve with a simple text-editor.
